    <h1>Archipelago</h1>
    <h2>A game made for CMPM 171 by Miles Marsh, Sean Rowley, Ewin Mathew, Mark Mcateer, and Samuel Liao</h2>
    Archipelago is a first person rouge-lite game made in Unreal Engine 5, where you fall from island to island fighting enemies while collecting treasure. <br> 
    However, the only way you can move around the islands is by using your weapon to propel you in unique and intersting ways. <br>
    This website is dedicated to the downloading and production of a vertical slice our team made for our game.<br>
